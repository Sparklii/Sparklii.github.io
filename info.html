<div class="header">About Me</div>
<p>My name is Katerina Marie Ibrahim. I'm a model, university student, fashion designer, cosplayer, and front-end web designer currently residing in Miami, USA. I am a signed professional model with <u><a href="http://runwaysthetalentgroup.com/">Runways the Talent Group</a></u> in Miami, USA, <u><a href="http://elementmodelmgmt.com/">Element Model Management</a></u> in Atlanta, USA, with modeling, runway, and film experience. Modeling has always been my dream job, so I couldn't be happier doing anything else. Currently I am studying software engineering at a small engineering university, with a concentration on front-end web development. I frequently design and create cosplay costumes and attend sci-fi/anime conventions, as well as dance costumes and fashion accessories.

<p>
<b>How can I book you for a modeling job or test photoshoot/video?</b><br>
Simply send me a message through my <u><a href="http://www.katerinadoll.com/contact.html">Contact</a></u> page. For paid work, I will then direct you to one of my agents depending on the city.
For unpaid/test work: I am highly selective of who I will model for free for, 
so please include a link to your portfolio as well as the concept and information about the job. I am also happy to work in exchange for clothing & merchandise.
</p>
<p>
<b>What modeling experience do you have?</b><br>
I have experience in modeling for high fashion, editorial, lifestyle, glamour, catalogue, and underwater photoshoots. 
I have been printed in several magazines (high fashion & glamour), websites (catalogue & lifestyle), 
and had a speaking role in a national commercial campaign for <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh8O8YVi6Ck">Robust Energy Drink</a></u>. 
I have starred in several model/fashion videos, as well as walked in runway shows for Atlanta and New York designers.

<b>Do you make or buy your cosplay costumes?</b><br>
I absolutely ALWAYS handmake my costumes with love and tears. It just wouldn't be the same if I wasn't the one who made it.
 The only thing I occasionally don't make myself are wigs, although 90% of the time they have been cut/styled/colored by me after purchasing.
</p>
<p>
<b>What cosplays have you done?</b><br>
In order, I have created and cosplayed costumes for the following: 
<ul>
<li>Oerba dia Vanille from Final Fantasy XIII</li>
<li>Ritz Malheur from Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</li>
<li>Panty from Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt</li>
<li>Victoria's Secret Angel - Purple Version</li>
</ul><br>
My Ritz costume won the Judge's Choice award in the MomoCon Costume Contest.<br>
Sadly, I do not have many photos at all of my costumes! If you are a photographer interesting in shooting any of my cosplays, please don't hesitate to contact me.
</p>
<p>
<b>Will you design my website for me?</b><br>
Absolutely! I am a freelance web designer, and designed this site you're currently on. <3 The background images were also made by me using Adobe Photoshop.
As of right now, I work only in HTML, CSS, and Photoshop. I'm working on learning Javascript, so that should become an applicable language in the near future.
Just send me a message to discuss details.
</p>
<p>
<b>I really like _____ outfit that you made. Can you make me one too?</b><br>
Yep! Just head on over to my <u><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SparkleDollz?ref=l2-shopheader-name">Etsy</a></u> page to see what is currently available to purchase.
Since I handmake everything, only a limited quantity of items are available for a period of time.
